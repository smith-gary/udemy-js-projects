6. Writeafunction('printGoals')thatreceivesanarbitrarynumberofplayer names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
7. Theteamwiththeloweroddismorelikelytowin.Printtotheconsolewhich team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
